# Introduction #

BenkyouKana is a game, written in Swift, for studying Japanese. For the time being it is iOS only.

# Current Functionality #

Right now it has all of the base Hiragana. It does not include those that are formed by combining two together, such as "kya", "chi", etc.

On load, the user is presented with a random hiragana. There is a text field below for entering the romaji equivalent. If the user input is correct, another random hiragana is presented. If the user is wrong, a red X is displayed with the correct answer below. The user can then try again.
